# Practical5

Neural Networks

## Overview
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2020/Practical5) you will be use neural networks to solve different problems. First you will examine how neural networks can be applied to tabular data

## What is in this Practical Session
1. Neural Networks for Diagnosis of Diabetes
2. Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order. Note that exercises will appear within the notebooks this time, so that you don't need to code everything from scratch. You may find it beneficial to go through the notebooks without doing the exercises first, then come back to them.

## Set up your notebook
Open up this repository in [binder]() to get started.
