These are very similar to the Dense layers we saw previously, but have an added variable `kernel_size`. Everything else in these layers you have seen before. Note that because we switch from binary classification to multi-class classification, the final activation function becomes a softmax.\n",

The mathematical term for this feature is a `kernel`. A kernel size of `(3,3)` will give a 3x3 matrix on our data. So a 3x3 matrix will scan across the whole image.\n",
