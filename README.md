# Practical5
Neural Networks

## Overview
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2020/Practical5) you will use neural networks to solve different problems. First you will examine how neural networks can be applied to tabular data, then you will explore convolutional neural networks for image classification.

The goal of this practical session is to show you that neural networks are much easier to code than to understand, and even simple networks can be very powerful.

Also, this is a great chance to ask questions about your project proposals that will be due this Friday. 

## What is in this Practical Session
1. Neural Networks for Diagnosis of Diabetes
2. Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order. Note that exercises will appear within the notebooks this time, so that you don't need to code everything from scratch. You may find it beneficial to go through the notebooks without doing the exercises first, then come back to them.

## Set up your notebook
Open up this repository in [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KF5012-AI2020/Practical5/9053cf524bd859bd7e59d180b5af31410a080830) to get started.

## Other resources
There is a lot of information about how to use Keras for different machine learning tasks. I particularly recommend [Francois Chollet's](https://github.com/fchollet/keras-resources) repository (Francois Chollet is the founder of Keras).
